# 2-->Navigate to the Project Directory by using the (cd Current reponame)

# 3-->install the node module files by using this command(npm install), It is the main folder without this folder we can not run the Application because it is the nodemodules folder stores all the external packages your project requires, from React itself to smaller utility libraries.

# 4-->After that connect the Tailwind Css to your Project by using (npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer npx tailwindcss init -p)after that Check for Tailwind Configuration: Look for a tailwind.config.js file in the project's root directory. If it exists, Tailwind CSS is likely already configured but if no then set up this 
# (/\*_ @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} _/
# module.exports = {
# content: [
# "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
# ],
# theme: {
# extend: {},
# },
# plugins: [],
# })

# 5-->Start the Application by using this command (npm run dev)
